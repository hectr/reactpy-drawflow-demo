# Drawflow - ReactPy Implementation

This project is a Python implementation of [Drawflow](https://github.com/jerosoler/Drawflow) — with some variations — using [ReactPy](https://reactpy.dev). The example demo uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) as the backend.

## Running the Demo

To run the demo, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn example:app --reload
```
